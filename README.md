# coq-list-solver

This repository contains the spplementary material of the master thesis with the title "List Theorem Solving" by Jeroen Kool.

The following is contained in this repository:
  * The solver for theorems about lists implemented in Coq (see directory `solver`);
  * The benchmarks that are used to compare the solver with existing work in Coq (see directory `solver/benchmarks`);
  * The benchmarks in SMT-LIB2.0 format, to solve the benchmarks with an SMT solver (see directory `SMT String Theory`);
  * The implementation that is used to verify with the program AProVE that the rewrite system discussed in the thesis is always terminating (see directory `AProVE`).
